### FRO Email Lists

All of Front Range Objectivism's mailing lists are hosted on [Google Groups](https://groups.google.com){:target="&lowbar;blank"}. That platform offers all the traditional functionality of a mailing list, plus a web interface. Use the links below to subscribe to FRO's mailing lists or to modify your existing subscriptions.

[FRO Announcements](http://groups.google.com/group/fro-frost){:target="&lowbar;blank"} is open to everyone and is for announcements of major FRO news and events, including talks.

[FROLIC](https://groups.google.com/g/fro-frolic){:target="&lowbar;blank"} is also open to everyone and is for announcement of [social events](/fro/social-events/).

These FRO lists are limited to members of each [study group](/fro/study-groups). They require an invitation to join.
* [1FROG](http://groups.google.com/group/fro-1frog){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* [2FROG](http://groups.google.com/group/fro-2frog){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* [3FROG](http://groups.google.com/group/fro-3frog){:target="&lowbar;blank"}
* [4FROG](http://groups.google.com/group/fro-4frog){:target="&lowbar;blank"}

You can see all the FRO lists to which you are subscribed [here](https://groups.google.com){:target="&lowbar;blank"}, provided that you are logged in and subscribed via your Google Account.

### How to Subscribe to a FRO List

Click on the link to the list to which you wish to subscribe. (You may need to sign in to your Google Account. If you do not have a Google Account, you must [create one](#how-to-create-a-google-account) first.) Then click on the "Ask to join this group" button.

Choose how you wish to receive list email and type in your real name. If you have multiple email addresses associated with your Google Account, you can select which email address to use for the FRO list. Then submit the form.

You should be subscribed.

### How to Create a Google Account

Go to [Google's New Account Form](https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount){:target="&lowbar;blank"}. Follow the instructions to create an account. If you like, you can associate a non-Gmail email address with your Google Account, then use that address to subscribe to FRO lists. Once you've created an account, follow the instructions above to subscribe to the FRO lists of your choice.

### How to Send Email to a FRO List

After you are subscribed to a FRO list, you can send email to it using the address listed on the main page of the Google Group. (Only the managers of [FRO Announcements](http://groups.google.com/group/fro-frost){:target="&lowbar;blank"} and [FROLIC](https://groups.google.com/g/fro-frolic){:target="&lowbar;blank"} have permission to post to those lists.)

Please note that you must send email from the address that is subscribed to the list. Also, in replying to messages from FRO lists, "reply all" will send your reply to the whole group, whereas just "reply" will send it privately to the person to whom you are replying.

### How to Unsubscribe from a FRO List

Click on the link to the list from which you wish to unsubscribe. (You may need to sign in to your Google Account.) Click on "My membership settings" in the side panel then the "Leave group" button next to the group's name.
