As of November 20, 2023, we are no longer automatically inviting the main FRO Google Groups to their respective events on the "central" FRO Calendar. Instead, we are maintaining separate Google Groups for each [FRO study group](/study-groups/) for those who wish to receive individual calendar events (that include location information and other details) on their personal calendars. (We will no longer be sending out calendar invitations for [FROLIC](/social-events/) events, since we use the [FROLIC Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/FROLIC-Denver/){:target="&lowbar;blank"} to manage events, including invitations and RSVPs.)

If you are in one of the [FRO study groups](/study-groups/) and wish to receive calendar invitations that will have their details automatically updated in your calendaring app, please [calendar inquiry](){: .email} (and be sure to send an email from the account that is connected to your calendar).
